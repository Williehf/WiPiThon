            <h2>The History</h2>
             <p>Welcome to my personal project hub—a space dedicated to my passion for science, 
                technology, and systems integration.<br>
                Driven by a curiosity for how things work and a desire to build, 
                I created this site to document my journey through various technical builds. 
                Here, you will find a collection of my past work and current experiments, 
                ranging from custom hardware prototypes to complex software integrations. 
                My work is built on a versatile foundation of languages and protocols, 
                including Linux, C/C++, Python, HTML/CSS,and communication standards like MQTT (Mosquitto), TCP, and WiFi.</p>

                        <strong>My Core Focus: Open Source Integration</strong> I am a firm believer in the power of the Home Assistant platform. 
                        My projects prioritize an open-source philosophy, utilizing a Raspberry Pi as 
                        the central brain to bridge the gap between commercial off-the-shelf devices and my own custom-coded creations.
                        By leveraging tools such as the Arduino IDE, Flask, AutoCAD, and Wireshark, 
                        I design tailored solutions that bring total control into a single, unified application. 
                        Whether you are a fellow developer or looking for inspiration for your own smart home setup, 
                        I hope these posts motivate you to start building.

                        <strong>RF Project: GMRS UHF Repeater for emergency disaster Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico:</strong> Hurricane Maria caused unprecedented damage, 
                        resulting in the collapse of all critical infrastructure, including communication networks, for an extended period. 
                        The inability to contact family and loved ones highlighted a critical vulnerability.
                        <br><strong>Project Goal:</strong>Establish a reliable, independent communication channel for my family and local area.
                        <br><strong>Repeater Specification:</strong> UHF Band - Off-grid or self-sufficient system - Remote control

                <h3>IoT Project:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Raspberry Pi Security Access Control</strong> Following the persistent power grid instability after 
                        Hurricane Maria, this project addresses a critical accessibility gap in telephone-based entry systems. 
                        During outages, the loss of internet and primary power often leaves residents stranded. 
                        I designed an automated integration that monitors the power supply; upon detecting a failure, 
                        it triggers the gate's battery backup to open the entrance automatically. 
                        Once utility power is restored, the system re-engages to close the gate, ensuring both emergency accessibility and long-term security.
                        <br><strong>The Solution</strong> Utilizes a Raspberry Pi integrated with a relay module to interface directly 
                        with the gate’s control board. A custom Python script continuously monitors internet connectivity as a proxy for grid stability. 
                        Upon detecting a loss of connectivity, the script triggers the Raspberry Pi’s internal GPIO pins to switch the relay, effectively bypassing 
                        the telephone entry system to open the gate. Once the internet connection is restored, 
                        the system automatically cycles the relay again to secure the entrance.
